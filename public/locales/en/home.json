      "vizziamDescription": "I independently developed a video recording application for 360° rotating platforms up to its third version and published it on Play Store. I integrated the app with an In-app purchases library for React Native to manage subscription plans. I used FFmpeg for video filtering, with the option of processing the video locally or remotely through a serverless Lambda function, and storing in an S3 Bucket. The application has an offline-first architecture and uses the Realm SDK for React Native. I implemented animations and touch-sensitive controls using the Gesture Handler and Reanimated libraries.",

The application has advanced features such as maps, geolocation, and an offline-first architecture with RealmDB. The app is distributed through AppCenter, and updates are made on-the-fly with CodePush. I also recreated the backend using NodeJS, following the Clean Architecture pattern, with unit and integration test suites that add up to more than 150 tests in total. The backend is containerized with Docker and Docker Compose and runs on Heroku."
